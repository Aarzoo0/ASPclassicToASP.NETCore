ASP Classic to ASP.NET Core MVC Migration Tool

ðŸ“Œ Overview:

This project automates the migration of ASP Classic projects to ASP.NET Core MVC using OpenAI API endpoints. 
The tool takes a GitHub repository URL as input, processes the ASP Classic code, and outputs a converted project as a downloadable ZIP file. 
The migration ensures proper project structuring, entity extraction, and adherence to best practices in ASP.NET Core


ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

-Backend:
FastAPI (Python) for API development
OpenAI API for code transformation
GitHub API for repo access
MySQL (if needed for entity extraction)

-Frontend:
React (Vite) for UI
Tailwind CSS for styling


ðŸŽ¯ How It Works:

Enter GitHub Repo URL â†’ The backend fetches and analyzes the ASP Classic project.
Extract and Convert â†’ The tool extracts database info, converts legacy code, and structures the new project.
Generate Output â†’ The final ASP.NET Core MVC project is structured and packaged.
Download ZIP â†’ The user receives a converted project.
